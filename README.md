# Dungeon3D
Dungeon3D is a small sample project that implements Doom-style psuedo-3D raytracing in the terminal display emulator AsciiPanel. 

It is an older, unfinished project, but the core display and visual functionality is done - you can explore a one-floor dungeon and fight field enemies. I hope to work on it more in the future, but wanted to share it as it is now for those who might enjoy it!

## Dependencies
Dungeon3D depends on AsciiPanel. As it is an older library that is no longer being developed, I have included a copy of the JAR in the /lib/ file, along with the licensing information. It is licensed under the MIT License; the JAR file is copyright (c) 2015 Trystan Spangler. Further details can be found in lib/LICENSE_asciiPanel.txt. 

Dungeon3D has no other dependencies - everything it needs to run is included.
